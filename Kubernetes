==============
Installation
--------------
1. Hard Way. (Manual installtion of all components like kubectl, kubelet, api server, scheduler etc)
2. Kubeadm ( utility). We download utility in kube master and cluster node, run it. it will install component kubectl, kubelet, api server etc 
3. Cloud prvoider. Pre-build kube cluster available in cloud providers like aws(EKS) and google cloud(GKE).

===============
Installation of Kube cluster with kubeadm utility

Step 1: Done on both Master and Node

Install Docker on all nodes, containerization tool used in this kube cluster.

Download kubeadm on all >>>


Step 2: 


Step3: Done on kube cluster. 

run token on kube node. 

================

In kubernetes we will not create container directly, we will create a pod. On top of pod we will create replicaset, service 
Pod will take image from containerization tool running and will create container inside it. 


Layer of abstraction on top of container. 
Container will not have ip address, while POD will have and it will be responsible of all communication. 

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

    What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
    The resources available to those applications
    The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance

A Kubernetes object is a "record of intent"--once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that object exists. By creating an object, you're effectively telling the Kubernetes system what you want your cluster's workload to look like; this is your cluster's desired state.

To work with Kubernetes objects--whether to create, modify, or delete them--you'll need to use the Kubernetes API. When you use the kubectl command-line interface, for example, the CLI makes the necessary Kubernetes API calls for you. You can also use the Kubernetes API directly in your own programs using one of the Client Libraries.
Object Spec and Status

Almost every Kubernetes object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status. For objects that have a spec, you have to set this when you create the object, providing a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its desired state.

The status describes the current state of the object, supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system and its components. The Kubernetes control plane continually and actively manages every object's actual state to match the desired state you supplied.

For example: in Kubernetes, a Deployment is an object that can represent an application running on your cluster. When you create the Deployment, you might set the Deployment spec to specify that you want three replicas of the application to be running. The Kubernetes system reads the Deployment spec and starts three instances of your desired application--updating the status to match your spec. If any of those instances should fail (a status change), the Kubernetes system responds to the difference between spec and status by making a correction--in this case, starting a replacement instance.

Kubernetes has several objects:
1. Pod. 


================
POD >> Smallest unit that can be deployed in kubernetes
----------------

basic command >> single command to create pod on kubernetes cluster. 

kubectl run pod1 --image nginx

kubectl get nodes               >>> TO GET KUBERNETES CLUSTER DETAILS. 
kubectl get pod                 
kubectl get pod -o wide
kubectl describe pod pod1

now we use manifest in companies 
kubectl explain pod | less

Service Object: Service object are used for external network connectivity to Pods. i.e Port maping. Service object is always created for running pods.


3 types of Service Objects:
1. NodePort. { Port mapping from host port to Pod port}
2. LoadBalancer. { Give external ip for communication }
3. ClusterIP. { Used for communication between Pods }

For Port mapping we need to give 3 ports details: 

1. Nodeport ie. the port of host
2. Service port ie port for service object created for pods.
3. Pod port ie the port on pod to access the application.

KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1
DESCRIPTION:
     Service is a named abstraction of software service (for example, mysql)

     the selector that determines which pods will answer requests sent through
     the proxy.
