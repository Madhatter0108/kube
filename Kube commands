=KUBERNETES: 


ARCHITECURE:

Consists of below mentioned components.

1. API SERVER.
2. SCHEDULER.
3. KUBELET.
4. ETCD.
5. 


Kubelet will take




==============
Installation
--------------
1. Hard Way. (Manual installtion of all components like kubectl, kubelet, api server, scheduler etc)
2. Kubeadm ( utility). We download utility in kube master and cluster node, run it. it will install component kubectl, kubelet, api server etc 
3. Cloud prvoider. Pre-build kube cluster available in cloud providers like aws(EKS) and google cloud(GKE).

===============
Installation of Kube cluster with kubeadm utility

Step 1: Done on both Master and Node

Install Docker on all nodes, containerization tool used in this kube cluster.

Download kubeadm on all >>>


Step 2: 


Step3: Done on kube cluster. 

run token on kube node. 

================

In kubernetes we will not create container directly, we will create a pod. On top of pod we will create replicaset, service 
Pod will take image from containerization tool running and will create container inside it. 


Layer of abstraction on top of container. 
Container will not have ip address, while POD will have and it will be responsible of all communication. 

================
POD >> Smallest unit that can be deployed in kubernetes
----------------

basic command >> single command to create pod on kubernetes cluster. 

kubectl run pod1 --image nginx

kubectl get nodes               >>> TO GET KUBERNETES CLUSTER DETAILS. 
kubectl get pod                 
kubectl get pod -o wide
kubectl describe pod pod1

now we use manifest in companies 
kubectl explain pod | less
